# Portfolio

This is a second personal portfolio site, where I showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The goal is to create a dynamic and interactive portfolio with a modern tech stack.

## Development Plan

The initial version of the portfolio will be built using only the frontend stack. This approach allows for a fast and simple development process, focusing on the UI, user experience, and responsiveness. The content will be hard-coded directly into the React app for the sake of simplicity and speed.

In the future, the portfolio will be reworked to integrate the backend and AWS, allowing for easier content management. This will include creating an admin dashboard for dynamically inserting and updating data (such as project details, skills, and other content) through the backend. AWS will also be used for connecting the frontend and backend, making the process of managing the portfolio more efficient and scalable.

## Stack

### **Frontend**

- **React**  
  Used for building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). React allows for a dynamic, responsive, and modern web application with reusable components.
- **TypeScript**  
  Adds type safety to JavaScript, improving the reliability and maintainability of the frontend code.
- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first CSS framework used to quickly build custom, responsive designs without writing custom CSS.

### **Backend**

- **.NET**  
  The backend is built using .NET to handle server-side logic and operations, such as managing and serving data to the frontend.
- **C#**  
  Used with .NET to create an admin dashboard, allowing me to manage and update portfolio content dynamically through a content management system (CMS). This eliminates the need to hard-code content directly into the React app.

### **AWS**

- **API Gateway**  
  Used to connect the frontend and backend, enabling seamless communication between the two.

- **S3**  
  Used for hosting the static frontend assets (such as HTML, CSS, and JS files) in a cost-effective and scalable manner, ensuring fast and reliable delivery to users.
